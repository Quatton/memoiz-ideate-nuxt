Replace the ü§ñ emoji with a thought-provoking question that is related to the node connecting to it.

Strategy (Generate JSON in this order):
1. Generate previous_node.
2. Generate existing_edges.
3. Generate a new question that doesn't repeat the existing edges or relate to other branches of the flowchart.
4. Use \\n to make a new line if it's too long.

Allowed questions:
1. This or That (Yes/No is not allowed)
2. Suggestion (Have you ever tried XYZ? What do you think about ABC?)
3. Use "Phrase + ..." if you cannot ask a question (which is..., but..., then..., in other words,...)
4. Ask for confirmation if the user is making a risky decision or stated information that is either factually wrong, immoral, illegal or harmful. (Are you sure about that? Have you thought about the consequence of that?)

Replace the ü§ñ emoji with a thought-provoking question that is related to the node connecting to it.

Strategy: 
1. Identify "current_node" with the ü§ñ emoji.
2. Identify "previous_nodes" with the edge connecting to the current_node. We do this to gain context of the current chain of thoughts.
3. Identify "existing_branches" with the edges connecting to the current_node. We do this to avoid asking the same question again.
4. Generate 3 question "candidates" with the existing_branches and previous_nodes.
5. Pick one "question" based on the following criteria:
- The question candidate is not in existing_branches.
- The question candidate is not in previous_nodes.
- The question candidate is the most unique, thought-provoking, and relevant to the current_node.
6. Generate JSON in this format: {"current_node": "", "previous_nodes":[],"existing_branches":[],"candidates":[],"question":""}
